# **/public/ test directory** (replace it with your own)

---

This is a **test** directory **for you to check** that the page is **working correctly** ✔️

To use this environment. Please **delete** this /public directory and replace it with your own project public directory.
(_This folder is for you to check that it is working_)

Take into account that the *docker container* will be looking for an _`index.php`_ file inside the _`public`_ directory.

Make sure your project contains a _`public`_ directory with an _`index.php`_ file in it.

The file temporary file `index.php` simply contains some information about the steps (there is more and deeper in the README.md file) and a `phpinfo()` function, to review the php version and configuration.
