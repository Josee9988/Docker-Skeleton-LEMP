# **Public directory**

This is a test directory **for you to check** that the page is **working correctly** ✔️

To use this stack. Please **delete** this public directory and replace it with your project public directory.

Take into account that the *docker image* will be looking for an _`index.php`_ file inside the _`public`_ directory.
Make sure your project contains a _`public`_ directory with an _`index.php`_ file.

The file temporary file `index.php` simply contains a `phpinfo()` function, to review the php version and configuration.
